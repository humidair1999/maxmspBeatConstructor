maxmspBeatConstructor

Here's a beat constructor for MaxMSP.

Load in three sound samples; in the instance of drum beat creation, likely
a bass drum, snare, and hi-hat sample. These samples are all tempo-synced,
and will play asynchronously, with waveforms appearing for each track.

The individual frequency and tempo of each track can also be modified,
which allows for virtually endless playback combinations of the three
tracks. Volume of each track can be adjusted as well.

Really fun for producing glitchy drum beats!
